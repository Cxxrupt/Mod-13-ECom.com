# Ecom.com 

This repository contains the backend for an e-commerce application. It provides API endpoints for managing products, categories, and tags. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and the Sequelize ORM.

## Technologies

The application is built with the following technologies:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL

## Installation

To install and run the application, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and provide your MySQL credentials in the following format:

DB_HOST=your_mysql_host

DB_USER=your_mysql_username

DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password

DB_DATABASE=your_mysql_database_name

Replace `your_mysql_host`, `your_mysql_username`, `your_mysql_password`, and `your_mysql_database_name` with your actual MySQL configuration.

4. Create the necessary database tables by executing the SQL script `db/schema.sql` in your MySQL database.
5. Seed the database with sample data by running the command `npm run seeds`.
